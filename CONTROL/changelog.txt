Forgejo v10.0

Forgejo v10.0 is the last version to allow a transparent upgrade from Gitea v1.22 or lower. In 2023 Forgejo was a soft fork, a set of patches maintained by the Forgejo community on top of Gitea. Early 2024 it became a hard fork and the codebases started to diverge. Forgejo and Gitea are now effectively different codebases although they share the same history back from the early days of Gogs.

- PR: When bleve is used for issue search, a fuzzy search now applies to each word instead of all of them, as if they were a phrase. For instance, searching for activitypub spam moderation previously returned no result in Forgejo discussions and now returns the relevant issues. If the search results are too broad, or for searching exact phrases prefer using an exact search. Sorting by newest is still available as a non default option under Sort. The query was also reworked to improve performances. It makes a significant difference for large instances such as Codeberg.
